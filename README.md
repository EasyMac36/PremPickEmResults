# PremPickEmResults
Automating the Prem Pick 'em results for games, matchups, and table. Will utilize an API to get results of the prem games each week. An API to use python code for functions and writing to Google Sheets. As of 11/30/2022 will still need to figure out a way to send answers from Prem Poll to GroupMe (possibly could take screenshot with Python function and send to GroupMe)
